# SuperStore_Sales_Data_PowerBI_Dashboard

In This Project I have created a Dashboard of a Super Store sales Data Using Microsoft Power BI Tool.

The DatSet Contained a CSV File with Important Columns Such as Order Date, Shipping Date, Quantity, Sales, Profit,Region, State, Segment etc.

So Using this Columns I have prepared a Power BI Dashboard to gain some Insights and trends from the Datset

Some of the Insights That can be gained from the Dashboard is that
* COD is the most preferable Mode of payment.
* Office Suppliments and Technology Related products are Top Selling Category of Products.
* Sales is Maximum in Western Regions.
* Most of the Customer Prefer Standard Shipping Mode.
* The Avg. Delivery Time Taken is 10 Days.
* Phones are among the top selling Sub Category Products.
